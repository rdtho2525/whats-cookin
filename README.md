# What's Cookin'?

What's Cookin' is a Mod2 paired project in the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). This recipe tracking / meal planning application allows users to view a variety of different recipes. Drawing influence from sites like All Recipes and New York Times Cooking, users are able to view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook.
